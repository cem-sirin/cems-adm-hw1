# Homework 1 for Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining, 2022-2023
I, Cem Sirin, created this repository to submit homework 1 for ADM, 2022-23. I have completed all the tasks in HackerRank that were assigned to me. In this repo, you will find the following files:

## sciripts.py
It is a .py file that contains all the HackerRank exercises from Problem 1 and Problem 2. The name of the exercises start with double hashtags (i.e., ##). The order follows my latest correct submission. The same order persists in the submissions.pdf file that is also in this repository. 

## submissions.pdf
It is a .pdf file that contains all the pages retrieved from "https://www.hackerrank.com/submissions/all". It contains the record of all my submissions including the wrong ones. As I have mentioned above, the problems are ordered from latest submissions to the earliest one.
